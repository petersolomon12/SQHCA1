### Software Quality Assurance 

---

Software Quality Assurance is a set of processes and activities that ensures that software meets specific/ high requirements. It means that the software performs how it is meant to and is free of defects. We look at the processes, product lifecycle, coding, design, testing etc. This is to ensure that all levels we are ensuring our requirements are met.

### Purpose Of Handbook

Collaborative work is important in a team, it ensures there is unity in the work being produced. A team in software development can consist of different individuals not just engineers but project managers. Good practices ensure that quality work is done and in a meaningful time. Less errors which ensures that quality product is being delivered to the client, better communication and changes are easily made. By following good practices teams can ensure that they are working efficiently and effectively, delivering high end quality product.

The goal of this handbook is to equip software engineers with a comprehensive set of best practices give and a clear understanding of their responsibilities and also what to avoid and the rewards of following good practices. We will provide short but effective information to deliver a clear meaningful handbook that will change the culture in this start-up.

By adhering to these guidelines, we aspire to enhance the quality of our code and minimize defects during production.
The handbook will consist of key topics related to Task Estimation, Code Reviews and Coding Standard.
