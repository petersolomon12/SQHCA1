### Team Improvements

Although the assignment went well all in all, there a few things we could do next time to better our experience as a team.

- Familiarise ourselves with the GitHub process more.
- Decide on a clear layout for the handbook, to create a more cohesive look.
- Work on our time management skills better, possibly by starting the assignment a bit earlier.
- We once committed an empty file by accident, so make sure that we are saving and committing the correct files.
- Give more constructive feedback, as there is always room to improve.
- Set goals for more tasks, which may help us achieve our overall goal faster.
- Do important tasks first.
- Collaborate more on ideas to encourage innovation.
- Discuss our strengths to optimise team performance
