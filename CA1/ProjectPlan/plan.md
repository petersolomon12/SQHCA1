- Introductory call to get accustomed to each other.
- Each member of team pick a specific topic to do. 
- Repository created by Peter, and adds colleagues as collaborators. 
- Repository cloned locally by each member of the group.
- Each member creates a branch to work on for their specific topic.
- When they have completed they commit their work and push for review.
- Depending on the magnitutde of the changes, pull request will require atleast one team member to ok for merging.
- Will meet periodically, to update on progress. (Atleast 3 meetings)

## GIT Process

Here are a list of steps to follow in order to acurately use git for this project work. This is to avoid conflicts and have a unilateral process being followed.

1. **git clone (Add Repository Locally)**.
2. **git checkout -b "Your Branch Name"**.
3. Start writing content.
4. When done, **"git add ."**.
5. **git commit -m "Write a message here"**. 
6. **git push**.
7. Go on GitHub website to the repository, it will tell you to create a pull request.
8. Once you create it, send a message to chat, each member will review it and leave a comment. Once everyone is ok with it.
9. Merge pull request.
10. **git checkout master**
11. **git pull**.
12. **git branch -d "Branch Name"** delete branch.
13. Repeat step 2.

### Team Improvements

Although the assignment went well all in all, there a few things we could do next time to better our experience as a team.

- Familiarise ourselves with the GitHub process more.
- Decide on a clear layout for the handbook, to create a more cohesive look.
- Work on our time management skills better, possibly by starting the assignment a bit earlier.
- We once committed an empty file by accident, so make sure that we are saving and committing the correct files.
- Give more constructive feedback, as there is always room to improve.
- Set goals for more tasks, which may help us achieve our overall goal faster.
- Do important tasks first.
- Collaborate more on ideas to encourage innovation.
- Discuss our strengths to optimise team performance.
