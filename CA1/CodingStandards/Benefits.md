- ## **Consistency** : 

-	Coding standards that ensures code in a project is written in a consistent style.
-	Ensures code is easy to read and understand.
-	Consistent naming conventions, formatting and commenting practices helps to reduce errors in code.
-	Improves code maintainability and sustainability of code.
-	Helps with identifying potential performance issues. Reduces memory usage.

- ## **Less Duplicates** : 

-	Helps identify areas of code that are similar or redundant.
-	Code efficiency and performance may be improved by adhering to coding standards that encourage code reuse.
-	Consistent coding rules and practices can help to guarantee that code is arranged logically and efficiently, lowering the possibility of duplicate code being added.
-	The following conventions can help to prevent unintentional or intentional code duplication.

- ## **Maintainability** : 

-	Coding standards and practices that are consistent can help developers comprehend and update code created by other team members or in various portions of the codebase.
-	By describing the code's operation, intent, and any dependencies or needs, properly documented code can aid in enhancing maintainability.
-	Code is predictable.

- ## **Easier Onboarding** : 
-	Consistent coding standards makes it easier for new team members to join.
-	Coding standards makes it easier for developers to identify the structure and purpose of the code.
-   This cuts down the time that new team members spend trying to learn the team's practices and increases optimisation.

- ## **Reduction of Development Cost** : 
- Good coding standard reduces the errors in a code thus you spend less time debugging, it saves time when working on a full scale project.
- It takes less time to build a project which implements good coding practices/standards.
- Easier to maintain, a project that is easier to maintain will be cheaper in cost as their isn't big labour cost being put in for the upkeeping.
